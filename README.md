# University_Management_System

Hi everyone! I'm excited to share a project I've been working on lately - a university management system built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in TypeScript!

This project has been a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to put my OOP knowledge into practice. I've explored concepts like classes, objects, constructors, access modifiers (public, private, protected), and static properties to create a system that can:
Manage student information (name, roll number, courses)
Handle faculty details (courses taught, salary, name)

Building this project has helped me solidify my understanding of OOP principles and gain valuable experience with TypeScript. I'm confident this project will be a valuable asset in my future endeavors!
